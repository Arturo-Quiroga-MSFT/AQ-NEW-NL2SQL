## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Cards Not Showing?
**Check logs:**
```bash
az containerapp logs show --name nl2sql-teams-bot --resource-group AQ-BOT-RG --tail 50
```

Look for:
- `[WARNING] Adaptive Cards module not found` → Rebuild image
- No warning → Cards are enabled ✅

### Card Rendering Error?
**Validate JSON:**
1. Copy card JSON from code
2. Go to https://adaptivecards.io/designer/
3. Paste and test

### Buttons Not Working?
- Buttons show but don't do anything yet
- Need to implement action handlers (Phase 2)
- For now, they're visual elements
