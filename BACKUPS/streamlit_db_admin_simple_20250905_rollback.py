"""Simple NL→DDL Admin Console

Purpose: Provide a minimal interface for a DB admin to:
  1. Enter natural language instructions (one or many lines)
  2. Parse into concrete DDL/DML admin actions (create table, add/drop column, drop table, create index, list/describe)
  3. Preview generated SQL statements
  4. (Optionally) execute with risk gating safeguards

Environment variables required:
  DB_SERVER, DB_DATABASE, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD

Run:
  streamlit run DB_Assistant/streamlit_db_admin_simple.py
