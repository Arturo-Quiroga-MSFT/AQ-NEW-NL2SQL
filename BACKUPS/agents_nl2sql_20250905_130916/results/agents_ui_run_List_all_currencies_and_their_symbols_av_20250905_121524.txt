Query: List all currencies and their symbols available in the database.

Intent & Entities (JSON):
{
  "intent": "List all currencies and their symbols available in the database.",
  "error": "'\"intent\"'"
}

Reasoning / Plan:
- Entities mapping: “currencies” → ref.Currency (CurrencyCode, CurrencyName, Symbol).
- Tables/Joins: Single-table query from ref.Currency; no joins required.
- Aggregations: None needed; return one row per currency.
- Filters: None; include all rows in ref.Currency. Optionally exclude rows with missing CurrencyCode or Symbol if required.
- Order/Limit: Order by CurrencyCode (or CurrencyName) ascending; no limit.
- Assumptions:
  - “Available in the database” means currencies defined in ref.Currency, not only those used by loans/payments.
  - CurrencyCode values are unique; use DISTINCT defensively if duplicates are possible.
  - Symbols may be null for some currencies; include them as-is unless instructed otherwise.

Generated SQL:
SELECT CurrencyCode, CurrencyName, Symbol
FROM ref.Currency
ORDER BY CurrencyCode

Sanitized SQL:
SELECT CurrencyCode, CurrencyName, Symbol
FROM ref.Currency
ORDER BY CurrencyCode
