Query: List all risk metrics for companies in the Technology industry.

Intent & Entities (JSON):
{
  "intent": "Retrieve all risk metric records for companies classified in the Technology industry, i.e., the metric names (and optionally values and as-of dates) tied to those companies. Join Companies/Issuers to Industry/Sector and the RiskMetrics/CompanyRiskMetric fact table, filter Industry = 'Technology'; no aggregation is needed unless deduplicating metric types (SELECT DISTINCT) or choosing the latest value per company (max as_of_date)."
}

Reasoning / Plan:
- Entities/Source Tables: use dbo.Company for company attributes (CompanyId, CompanyName, Industry) and dbo.RiskMetricHistory for risk metrics (CompanyId, AsOfDate, MetricName, MetricValue, Source). Return columns such as CompanyName, Industry, MetricName, MetricValue, AsOfDate, and optionally Source.
- Link logic: relate dbo.RiskMetricHistory.CompanyId to dbo.Company.CompanyId to attach each metric record to its company and industry classification.
- Filters: include only records where dbo.Company.Industry equals 'Technology' (consider case-insensitive comparison). Optionally add a date window on AsOfDate if the result set needs to be curtailed to recent periods.
- Aggregations: no aggregation required for full history. If only one record per company and metric is desired, deduplicate by keeping the latest AsOfDate per (CompanyId, MetricName); if multiple rows share the same latest AsOfDate, break ties using RiskMetricHistoryId or keep all tied rows.
- Ordering/Limit: sort results by CompanyName ascending, then MetricName ascending, then AsOfDate descending to show most recent values last in each group. Apply a row count restriction only if a preview is needed (otherwise return all qualifying rows).
- Potential edge cases: companies with null or blank Industry; inconsistent casing or trailing spaces in Industry values; metrics with null MetricValue or null AsOfDate; multiple metric entries on the same date; orphaned metric rows without a matching company (exclude via inner relationship or include via outer relationship if desired); very large result sets if many historical records exist.
- Assumptions/Notes: prefer base tables (Company and RiskMetricHistory) since this is not a loan-portfolio question; no currency handling needed; ensure predicates on Industry and join keys are sargable for performance.
