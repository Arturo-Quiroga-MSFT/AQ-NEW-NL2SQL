========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
Show 20 covenants with covenant type, threshold, frequency, and status.

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
**Intent:**  
Retrieve a list of covenants with specific attributes, limited to 20 results.

**Entities:**  
- Entity: covenants  
- Attributes: covenant type, threshold, frequency, status  
- Limit: 20

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: The query focuses on covenants and their attributesâ€”covenant type, threshold, frequency, and status.
- Tables/Joins: Use the dbo.Covenant table directly, as all required attributes are present in this table; no joins are needed for these fields.
- Aggregations: No aggregation required.
- Filters: No explicit filters unless further specified; select all covenants.
- Order/Limit: Apply a LIMIT of 20 results; optionally, order by CovenantId or another relevant field if needed for consistency.
- Assumptions: Assumes no additional filtering criteria (e.g., on status or type); returns any 20 covenants with their specified attributes.
