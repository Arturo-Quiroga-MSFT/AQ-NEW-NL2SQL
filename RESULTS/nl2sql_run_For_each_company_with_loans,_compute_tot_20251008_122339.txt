========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
For each company with loans, compute total principal amount; show the top 20 companies by total principal.

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
**Intent:**  
- Retrieve the top 20 companies with loans, ranked by their total principal amount.

**Entities:**  
- Company  
- Loan  
- Principal amount  
- Top 20

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities Mapping: Companies are identified via the Company table; their associated loans and principal amounts are found in the Loan table.
- Tables/Joins: Join Company and Loan tables on CompanyId to link each company to its loans.
- Aggregations: Sum PrincipalAmount per company to get each companyâ€™s total principal.
- Filters: Only include companies that have at least one loan (i.e., inner join or filter for companies with loans).
- Order/Limit: Rank companies by total principal amount in descending order; return only the top 20.
- Assumptions: Only loans in the Loan table are considered; company name or identifier will be included for clarity. No additional filters (e.g., status, date) unless specified.
