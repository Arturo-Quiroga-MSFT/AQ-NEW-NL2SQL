========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
For each company with loans, compute total principal amount; show the top 20 companies by total principal.

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: principal_amount -> Loan.PrincipalAmount; company_id -> Company.CompanyId; company_name -> Company.CompanyName.
- Tables/Joins: Use base tables; INNER JOIN dbo.Loan to dbo.Company on Loan.CompanyId = Company.CompanyId (ensures companies have loans).
- Aggregations: SUM(Loan.PrincipalAmount) as total_principal; GROUP BY Company.CompanyId, Company.CompanyName. Optionally COALESCE principal to 0 to avoid nulls.
- Filters: No additional filters beyond the join (implicitly enforces “at least one loan”).
- Order/Limit: ORDER BY total_principal DESC; return top 20 rows.
- Assumptions: No FX conversion (totals are in native loan currencies); include all loans regardless of status/date; one row per loan in dbo.Loan (no duplicates). Using base tables rather than vw_LoanPortfolio to ensure company_id is available.

========== GENERATED SQL (RAW) ==========
SELECT TOP (20)
    c.CompanyId AS company_id,
    c.CompanyName AS company_name,
    SUM(l.PrincipalAmount) AS total_principal
FROM dbo.Company AS c
INNER JOIN dbo.Loan AS l
    ON l.CompanyId = c.CompanyId
GROUP BY c.CompanyId, c.CompanyName
ORDER BY total_principal DESC

========== SANITIZED SQL (FOR EXECUTION) ==========
SELECT TOP (20)
    c.CompanyId AS company_id,
    c.CompanyName AS company_name,
    SUM(l.PrincipalAmount) AS total_principal
FROM dbo.Company AS c
INNER JOIN dbo.Loan AS l
    ON l.CompanyId = c.CompanyId
GROUP BY c.CompanyId, c.CompanyName
ORDER BY total_principal DESC
