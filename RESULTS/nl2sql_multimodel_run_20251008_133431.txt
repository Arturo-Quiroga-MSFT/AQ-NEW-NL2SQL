USER QUESTION:
For each company with loans, compute total principal amount; show the top 20 companies by total principal.

================================================================================
INTENT & ENTITIES (extracted with gpt-4o-mini):
================================================================================
```json
{
  "intent": "calculate",
  "entities": {
    "table": "dbo.Loan",
    "columns": ["CompanyId", "PrincipalAmount"]
  },
  "timeframe": null,
  "aggregations": {
    "group_by": "CompanyId",
    "total": "SUM(PrincipalAmount)"
  },
  "filters": null
}
```

================================================================================
REASONING (generated with gpt-4.1):
================================================================================
Certainly! Here is my reasoning for the query based on your intent and the provided schema:

---

### 1. What tables and relationships you'll use

**Table:**  
- I will use the `dbo.Loan` table.  
- This table directly contains both `CompanyId` (identifying the company that received the loan) and `PrincipalAmount` (the value of each loan).

**Relationships:**  
- For this specific intent, which is to aggregate principal amounts by company, there’s no need to join to other tables. All required columns exist in `dbo.Loan`.

---

### 2. What calculations or aggregations are needed

**Aggregation:**  
- You want the total principal amount outstanding for each company.
- This requires grouping the data by `CompanyId` and applying the `SUM` function to `PrincipalAmount` for each group.

---

### 3. Any filtering or sorting logic

**Filtering:**  
- No specific filters are requested (e.g., by status, date, region), so the query will include all loans.

**Sorting:**  
- The user hasn’t requested a sort order.  
- If a sort is needed (e.g., to see largest exposures first), adding `ORDER BY SUM(PrincipalAmount) DESC` would be typical.

---

### 4. Why this approach is optimal

- **Direct access to required fields:** All necessary data resides in a single table (`dbo.Loan`), so no joins are needed. This makes the query simple and efficient.
- **Exactly matches intent:** The aggregation (`SUM(PrincipalAmount) GROUP BY CompanyId`) aligns perfectly with the user’s request for total principal by company.
- **Performance:** Since there's no joining or unnecessary complexity, the query will run efficiently and is easy to maintain.
- **Scalability:** Can be extended with filters, joining with `Company` for names, or more complex logic if needed in the future.

---

**Summary:**  
I’ll use a straightforward aggregation on the `dbo.Loan` table to sum up the principal amounts per company, grouping by `CompanyId`, as this directly answers the user’s question in the most efficient manner possible.

AI SUMMARY (generated with gpt-4.1-mini):
================================================================================
Summary:
The analysis calculated the total principal loan amount for each company that has borrowed funds. The results reveal a range of total principal amounts across companies.

Key Insights:
- The highest total principal amounts per company are 25 million.
- Companies with IDs 2 and 14 top the list with total principal loans of 25 million.
- Several companies (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 15) have totals around 22 million.
- A sizable number of companies have principal totals around 18 million and some at 12 million.
- The principal amounts appear clustered around these three values (25M, 22M, 18M, and 12M), indicating common borrowing tiers.

Notable Statistics:
- Highest total principal: 25,000,000 (Company 2, Company 14)
- Lowest total principal in top 15: 12,000,000 (Multiple companies)
- Number of companies with 22M principal: 4 (Companies 6,7,8,15)
- Number of companies with 18M principal: 5 (Companies 3,4,5,13, and Company 1 with 24M close to that tier)

Answer:
The top 20 companies by total principal loan amount feature totals ranging from approximately 12 million to 25 million. Companies 2 and 14 lead with total principals of 25 million each, followed closely by several companies with totals around 22 million and 18 million. This demonstrates distinct borrowing bands among the top loan holders.
