    "columns": ["CollateralId", "Description", "ValueAmount", "CompanyName"]

## Reasoning

*Generated with `gpt-4.1`*

```
Sure! Here’s my high-level reasoning and plan for answering this query:

### 1. **Tables and Relationships**

- **dbo.Collateral**: This is the primary table since the user wants a list of collateral records, including `CollateralId`, `Description`, and `ValueAmount`.
- **dbo.Loan**: We need this because each collateral is linked to a loan via `Collateral.LoanId = Loan.LoanId`.
- **dbo.Company**: We need company details, specifically `CompanyName`. Each loan is linked to a company via `Loan.CompanyId = Company.CompanyId`.

**Relationship path:**  
Collateral → Loan → Company

### 2. **Calculations or Aggregations Needed**

- **None required**: The user just wants a list of matching collateral records with their associated company names—no aggregation or calculation is specified.

### 3. **Filtering or Sorting Logic**

- **Filter:** Only include collateral where `ValueAmount > 1,000,000`.
- **No sorting** is requested, so the default order will suffice unless specified otherwise.

### 4. **Why This Approach is Optimal**

- **Direct Join Path**: We’re using the minimal set of joins necessary to retrieve all requested fields, following the foreign-key relationships.
- **Base Tables**: The question is not portfolio-summarization, just listing and filtering by value. So it’s best to use base tables directly (not the denormalized view).
- **Efficient Filtering**: Applying the value filter first (at the Collateral table level) reduces join overhead by discarding irrelevant rows early.
- **Simple, Readable SQL**: Follows best practices for maintainability and performance.

---

**Summary of steps:**
- Start at `dbo.Collateral`, filter to `ValueAmount > 1,000,000`
- Join to `dbo.Loan` on `LoanId`
- Join to `dbo.Company` on `CompanyId`
- Select the required columns

This approach meets the user’s needs directly and is both simple and efficient.
