========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
For each company with loans, compute total principal amount; show the top 20 companies by total principal.

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
**Intent:**  
Retrieve and rank companies based on the total principal amount of their loans.

**Entities:**  
- **Company** (with loans)
- **Loan**
- **Principal amount**
- **Top 20 companies** (by total principal)

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: Companies with associated loans, aggregating loan principal amounts per company.
- Tables/Joins: Use dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio for simplicity (contains CompanyName and PrincipalAmount); group by company. Alternatively, join dbo.Loan and dbo.Company if more detail needed.
- Aggregations: Sum PrincipalAmount for each company.
- Filters: Exclude companies with zero total principal or no loans.
- Order/Limit: Sort companies by total principal (descending); limit results to top 20.
- Assumptions: Only active/valid loans are considered; use CompanyName for display. No currency normalization unless specified.
