USER QUESTION:
For each company with loans, compute total principal amount; show the top 20 companies with their names, by total principal.

================================================================================
INTENT & ENTITIES (extracted with gpt-4o-mini):

```json
{
  "intent": "calculate",
  "entities": {
    "table": "dbo.Loan",
    "columns": ["CompanyName", "PrincipalAmount"]

REASONING (generated with gpt-4.1):
================================================================================
Certainly! Here’s my step-by-step reasoning for how to approach this query, based on the user’s intent and the CONTOSO-FI database schema:

---

## 1. Tables and Relationships to Use

- **Primary Table:** `dbo.Loan` is needed to access the `PrincipalAmount`.
- **Related Table:** `dbo.Company` provides the `CompanyName` because `dbo.Loan` stores only the `CompanyId`.
- **Relationship:** `dbo.Loan.CompanyId` links to `dbo.Company.CompanyId`. I need to join these two tables to associate each loan’s principal amount with the correct company name.

---

## 2. Required Calculations / Aggregations

- **Aggregation:** The query must calculate the **sum of PrincipalAmount for each company**. This means, after joining, I should group by `CompanyName` and sum the linked `PrincipalAmount`.

---

## 3. Filtering or Sorting Logic

- **Filters:** None are requested, so all loans and all companies are considered.
- **Sorting:** Not specified by the user. If clarity or presentation is needed, I might sort by total principal amount (descending) or company name (ascending), but this is optional.

---

## 4. Why This Approach is Optimal

- **Direct Mapping:** I use the base tables because the requirement is simple (sum by company), and I need fields (`CompanyName` from `dbo.Company` and `PrincipalAmount` from `dbo.Loan`) not available directly in a single table.
- **Minimal Joins:** Only one necessary join is required (Loan → Company), making it efficient.
- **Accurate Aggregation:** By grouping by `CompanyName`, I ensure the calculation is at the correct company granularity.
- **Schema Compliance:** This method adheres to best practices, leveraging schema relationships and returning precisely what the user requested.

---

**Summary:**  
I’ll join `dbo.Loan` to `dbo.Company` on `CompanyId`, group by `CompanyName`, then sum `PrincipalAmount` for each group. This provides the total loan amounts by company as requested, with minimal complexity and guaranteed accuracy.
