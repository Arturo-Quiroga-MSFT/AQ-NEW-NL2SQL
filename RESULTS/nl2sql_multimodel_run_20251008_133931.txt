USER QUESTION:
For each company with loans, compute total principal amount; show the top 20 companies by total principal. show names too


================================================================================
INTENT & ENTITIES (extracted with gpt-4o-mini):
================================================================================
```json
{
  "intent": "calculate",
  "entities": {
    "table": "dbo.Loan",
    "columns": [
      "CompanyId",
      "PrincipalAmount"
    ],
    "additional_columns": [
      "CompanyName"
    ]
  },

  },
  "filters": null
}
```

================================================================================
REASONING (generated with gpt-4.1):
================================================================================
Certainly! Here is my step-by-step reasoning for constructing the query based on your intent:

---

## 1. Tables and Relationships

- **Primary table:** `dbo.Loan` — This table contains loan-level data, including `CompanyId` (which identifies the borrower) and `PrincipalAmount` (the loan size).
- **Related table:** `dbo.Company` — This is required to retrieve the `CompanyName` for each `CompanyId`.
- **Relationship:** The query will join `dbo.Loan.CompanyId = dbo.Company.CompanyId` to associate each loan with its company and company name.

---

## 2. Calculations or Aggregations Needed

- **Sum aggregation:** For each company, we need to calculate the **total principal amount** across all their loans. This requires `SUM(PrincipalAmount)` grouped by `CompanyId`.
- **Grouping:** The aggregation must be grouped by both `CompanyId` (as requested) and, for display, `CompanyName`.

---

## 3. Filtering or Sorting Logic

- **Filtering:** There are no filters specified (e.g., on dates, status, or regions).
- **Sorting:** The result should be ordered by the total principal amount in **descending** order, so the companies with the largest aggregate loan exposure appear first.
- **Limiting:** The result set should be limited to the **top 20 companies**.

---

## 4. Why This Approach is Optimal

- **Directness:** The base tables (`Loan` and `Company`) are used directly, which is efficient for basic aggregations and ensures all relevant columns are available.
- **Simplicity:** Only a single join is required (to get company names), and the aggregation is straightforward.
- **Efficient grouping:** By grouping at the company level and ordering by total principal, it answers the business question concisely.
- **Scalability:** The logic will work even if companies have multiple loans, and distributing the grouping/aggregation ensures the correct sums.
- **Relevance:** The columns selected and logic implemented are exactly aligned with the entities and aggregations specified in the user intent.

---

## Final Query Logic (for context):

```sql
SELECT
    l.CompanyId,
    c.CompanyName,
    SUM(l.PrincipalAmount) AS total_principal
FROM
    dbo.Loan l
INNER JOIN
    dbo.Company c ON l.CompanyId = c.CompanyId
GROUP BY
    l.CompanyId, c.CompanyName
ORDER BY
    total_principal DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 20 ROWS ONLY;
```
---

**Summary:**  
This approach is clear, direct, and efficient for summarizing total loan principal by company and reporting the top 20 results.
