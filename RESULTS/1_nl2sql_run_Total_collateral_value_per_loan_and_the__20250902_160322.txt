========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: loan_id -> vw_LoanPortfolio.LoanId; company_name -> vw_LoanPortfolio.CompanyName; total_collateral_value -> SUM(Collateral.ValueAmount).
- Tables/Joins: Start from dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio (portfolio view). Inner join dbo.Collateral on LoanId to get collateral values. No need to join Company separately (CompanyName is in the view).
- Aggregations: SUM(ValueAmount) as total collateral value, GROUP BY LoanId, CompanyName.
- Filters: None specified. Optionally filter Collateral.Status = 'Active' if only active collateral should be counted.
- Order/Limit: None specified; omit ORDER BY and LIMIT.
- Assumptions: 
  - Collateral values are in comparable currency; no FX conversion applied. 
  - Include only loans that have at least one collateral record (inner join). 
  - Each row in Collateral represents the current value; if multiple valuations exist per CollateralId, use latest valuation per CollateralId before summing (otherwise straightforward sum).
