========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
Show 20 covenants with covenant type, threshold, frequency, and status.

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
- Intent: Retrieve a list of covenant records (view data)
- Entities/Parameters:
  - Entity/Table: covenants
  - Selected fields: covenant_type, threshold, frequency, status
  - Limit: 20
  - Filters: none specified
  - Sort: not specified
  - Distinct: not specified

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: “covenants” maps to dbo.Covenant; fields map to CovenantType, Threshold, Frequency, Status.
- Tables/Joins: Single-source from dbo.Covenant; no joins needed since requested fields are native to Covenant.
- Aggregations: None required (simple row retrieval).
- Filters: None (no WHERE clause specified). Will return any status/loan unless later constrained.
- Order/Limit: Limit to 20 rows using a TOP 20 approach. No ORDER BY specified; note results are nondeterministic without an explicit sort. Add ORDER BY (e.g., CovenantId or CovenantType) if deterministic order is needed.
- Assumptions: No distinct needed; include all statuses; no portfolio view necessary; no additional loan/company context required unless requested.

========== GENERATED SQL (RAW) ==========
SELECT TOP (20)
    c.CovenantType AS covenant_type,
    c.Threshold AS threshold,
    c.Frequency AS frequency,
    c.Status AS status
FROM dbo.Covenant AS c;

========== SANITIZED SQL (FOR EXECUTION) ==========
SELECT TOP (20)
    c.CovenantType AS covenant_type,
    c.Threshold AS threshold,
    c.Frequency AS frequency,
    c.Status AS status
FROM dbo.Covenant AS c;
