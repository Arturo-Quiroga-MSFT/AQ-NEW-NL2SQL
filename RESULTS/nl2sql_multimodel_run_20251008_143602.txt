USER QUESTION:
List all collateral items valued above 1,000,000. show customer names

REASONING (generated with gpt-5-mini):
================================================================================
Plan summary (what I will run and why)

1) Tables and relationships I'll use
- dbo.Collateral (primary source of Description and ValueAmount). Key column Collateral.LoanId.
- dbo.Loan (to link collateral to the borrower via Loan.CompanyId).
- dbo.Company (to retrieve CompanyName).
- Join path: dbo.Collateral -> dbo.Loan on Collateral.LoanId = Loan.LoanId -> dbo.Company on Loan.CompanyId = Company.CompanyId.
- Join type: INNER JOINs (we want collaterals that are tied to a loan and a company). If you need collaterals with missing loan/company rows, use LEFT JOINs insteadâ€”I'll pick INNER by default because the user requested CompanyName for each row.

2) Calculations / aggregations needed
- None required. The user asked for raw columns: Collateral.Description, Collateral.ValueAmount, Company.CompanyName.
- Note: no GROUP BY or aggregates are necessary.
- Optional enrichment (if desired):
  - Convert ValueAmount to a canonical currency using ref.FXRateDaily if collaterals have mixed CurrencyCode and you want comparable values.
  - Filter or compute most recent ValuationDate if you only want the latest valuation per collateral.

3) Filtering and sorting logic
- Filter: Collateral.ValueAmount > 1,000,000 (apply this in the WHERE clause).
- Additional recommended filters (optional):
  - Collateral.Status = 'Active' to exclude retired/archived collateral values.
  - ValuationDate = (most recent) if you only want current valuations.
- Sorting: default ordering I would apply is ORDER BY ValueAmount DESC so the largest collaterals show first (you can change to CompanyName or ValuationDate as required).
- Null handling: ensure ValueAmount is not null before comparison (WHERE ValueAmount > 1000000 implicitly excludes nulls).

4) Why this approach is optimal
- Minimal, explicit joins follow the defined FK relationships (Collateral -> Loan -> Company) so the query is simple and correct.
- No unnecessary aggregations or extra tables, so it is efficient and readable.
- Using an index on Collateral.LoanId and Loan.CompanyId (typical PK/FK indexes) will make the joins fast; filtering on ValueAmount is a straightforward numeric comparison.
- Optional currency normalization or valuation-date logic is flagged as a follow-up if you need cross-currency comparability or the most recent valuations.

Notes / considerations
- If you expect multiple collateral rows per loan and want one row per company aggregated (e.g., sum of collateral values per company), we would add GROUP BY CompanyName and SUM(ValueAmount).
- If ValueAmount can be in different currencies and you need a single-threshold interpretation (>$1,000,000), we must normalize currencies first.
- I will return a single SELECT statement (no USE/GO) and will parameterize the threshold if this will be run programmatically.
