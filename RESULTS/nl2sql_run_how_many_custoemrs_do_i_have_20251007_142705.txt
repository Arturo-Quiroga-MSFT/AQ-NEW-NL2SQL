========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
how many custoemrs do i have

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
**Intent:** Retrieve the count of customers.

**Entities:**
- Entity: customers (refers to the 'customers' table or collection)
- Attribute: count (number of customers)

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: "Customers" refers to companies or customer profiles in the schema; likely mapped to dbo.Company or dbo.CustomerProfile.
- Tables/Joins: For a simple count, use dbo.Company (each row is a customer company); if more granularity is needed (e.g., legal entities), use dbo.CustomerProfile.
- Aggregations: Perform a COUNT aggregate to get the total number of customers.
- Filters: No filters required unless specifically requested (e.g., active customers).
- Order/Limit: Not applicable for a count query.
- Assumptions: Assume "customer" means a company in dbo.Company unless clarified otherwise; counting unique CompanyId values. No need to join other tables for this intent.

========== GENERATED SQL (RAW) ==========
SELECT COUNT(*) AS CustomerCount
FROM dbo.CustomerProfile
