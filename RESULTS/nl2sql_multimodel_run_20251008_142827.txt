REASONING (generated with gpt-4.1):
================================================================================
Certainly! Here’s my step-by-step reasoning for how I would approach this query, based on the user’s intent, the database schema, and the guidelines provided:

---

### 1. **Tables and Relationships**
- **Table/View Used:** I will use the view `dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio`.
    - **Why:** The question is simple (“list” columns directly from the loan portfolio) and the included columns (MaturityDate, PrincipalAmount, Status, CompanyName) are directly available in this view.
    - This view is denormalized and contains all requested information, so no joins or relationships between base tables are necessary for this query.

---

### 2. **Calculations or Aggregations**
- **No aggregations are required** (i.e., no sums or averages), but we are asked for a "top 10" list.
    - “Top 10” is a row limitation, not an aggregation. Since PrincipalAmount is one of the columns, it makes sense that “Top 10” refers to the largest loans (by PrincipalAmount).
    - If the sort order was unclear, the default interpretation for a financial portfolio is to show the top 10 highest values of “PrincipalAmount”.

---

### 3. **Filtering and Sorting Logic**
- **Filtering**
    - **MaturityDate > current date**: Only upcoming (not yet matured) loans should be returned. This means loans with a MaturityDate greater than today.
- **Sorting**
    - **Order by PrincipalAmount DESC**: To get the “top 10” by loan size, sort by PrincipalAmount in descending order.
    - If more specificity is needed (e.g., ties), could further order by MaturityDate ascending (sooner maturities first) or some other secondary criterion.
- **Limiting Rows**
    - Select only the first 10 rows after sorting (“TOP 10” or “FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS” depending on SQL dialect).

---

### 4. **Why This Approach is Optimal**
- **Simplicity:** Using the `vw_LoanPortfolio` view is fast and avoids unnecessary joins or complex logic.
- **Performance:** The columns are already denormalized, so the query will perform efficiently with simple selection, filtering, sorting, and row limitation.
- **Maintainability:** The approach is concise, easy to read, and aligns with best practices for simple portfolio queries per provided guidelines.
- **Accuracy:** Filtering directly on MaturityDate and ordering by PrincipalAmount ensures only relevant, upcoming, and largest loans are displayed.

**Summary**:  
Select the four requested columns from `vw_LoanPortfolio`, filter out matured loans, sort by loan size, and present only the top 10. This uses minimal resources, avoids unnecessary complexity, and follows both the data model and user requirements exactly.
