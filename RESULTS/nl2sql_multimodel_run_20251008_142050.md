## Intent & Entities

{
  "intent": "list",
  "entities": {
    "table": "dbo.Company",

## Reasoning

```
1) Tables and relationships I'll use
- Primary table: dbo.Company — it contains the requested columns (CompanyName, Industry, CreditRating).
- No joins are required for the specified columns. (If you later want location or regional context, I would join ref.Country via Company.CountryCode; if you want exposure or loan data I would join dbo.Loan on Company.CompanyId.)

2) Calculations or aggregations needed
- None. You asked for a straight list of three columns; no aggregate functions, weighting, or derived metrics are required.
- I will consider simple null handling when presenting results (for example showing NULLs as-is or replacing with a placeholder), but that’s a presentation choice rather than a calculation.

3) Filtering or sorting logic
- No filters specified, so the base plan returns all rows from dbo.Company with those three columns.
- Recommended default sort: ORDER BY CompanyName to produce a stable, user-friendly listing. If you prefer another order (by CreditRating, Industry, or only companies with non-null CreditRating) we can add an appropriate WHERE or ORDER BY clause.
- For large result sets, implement pagination (OFFSET ... FETCH) to avoid returning excessive rows in one go.

4) Why this approach is optimal
- Minimal data movement: selecting only the requested columns reduces I/O and network transfer.
- Simplicity and correctness: the columns live in dbo.Company, so no joins or denormalization are required — this avoids join costs and potential semantic ambiguity.
- Flexibility: the simple base query is easy to extend later (e.g., joining ref.Country for country names, joining dbo.Loan for exposures, or adding filters/aggregations) without rewriting complex logic.
- Performance considerations: selecting a small projection allows the query to use existing indexes efficiently (CompanyId is the PK; ordering by CompanyName will benefit from an index on that column if one exists).

If you want, I can produce the exact SELECT statement (with optional ordering, filters, or pagination) next.
