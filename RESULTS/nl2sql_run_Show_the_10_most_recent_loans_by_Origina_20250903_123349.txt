========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
Show the 10 most recent loans by OriginationDate.

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
- Intent: Retrieve the 10 most recent loan records.
- Entities:
  - Table: loans
  - Order by: OriginationDate
  - Sort direction: DESC (most recent first)
  - Limit: 10

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: “loans” maps to dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio (preferred for portfolio queries).
- Tables/Joins: Use dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio only; no joins required since needed fields are in the view.
- Aggregations: None needed; simple retrieval.
- Filters: No explicit filters; include all loans as-of the view. (No status/currency constraints unless specified.)
- Order/Limit: Sort by OriginationDate descending to get most recent; apply TOP 10 (SQL Server). Optional tie-breaker by LoanId DESC.
- Assumptions: “Most recent” is determined solely by OriginationDate; OriginationDate is populated for all returned rows; no need to de-duplicate beyond LoanId uniqueness.
