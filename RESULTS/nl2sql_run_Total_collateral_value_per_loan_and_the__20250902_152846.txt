========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
Total collateral value per loan and the associated company name.

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
{
  "intent": "Retrieve the total collateral value aggregated per loan, along with each loan's associated company name.",
  "entities": {
    "measure": {
      "field": "collateral_value",
      "aggregation": "sum",
      "alias": "total_collateral_value"

    "dimensions": [

    "filters": []
  }
}

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- Entities mapping: LoanId and CompanyName from dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio; collateral value from dbo.Collateral.ValueAmount.
- Tables/Joins: Use dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio as base; LEFT JOIN dbo.Collateral ON LoanId to include loans with no collateral.
- Aggregations: SUM(Collateral.ValueAmount) as total_collateral_value; GROUP BY LoanId, CompanyName.
- Filters: None specified; do not apply status/date filters. Optionally ensure Collateral.ValueAmount is not null in aggregation.
- Order/Limit: ORDER BY LoanId (ascending) for readability; no LIMIT.
- Assumptions: 
  - CompanyName is reliably available in vw_LoanPortfolio (no need to join dbo.Company).
  - Collateral values are summed in their recorded currency; no FX normalization. If mixed currencies exist per loan, results may not be comparable.
  - Show 0 for loans without collateral via COALESCE on SUM.

========== GENERATED SQL (RAW) ==========
SELECT
  p.LoanId AS loan_id,
  p.CompanyName AS company_name,
  COALESCE(SUM(c.ValueAmount), 0) AS total_collateral_value
FROM dbo.vw_LoanPortfolio AS p
LEFT JOIN dbo.Collateral AS c
  ON c.LoanId = p.LoanId
GROUP BY
  p.LoanId,
  p.CompanyName
