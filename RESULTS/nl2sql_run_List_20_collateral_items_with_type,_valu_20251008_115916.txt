========== NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY ==========
List 20 collateral items with type, value, valuation date, and the related LoanNumber.

========== INTENT & ENTITIES ==========
**Intent:**  
Retrieve a list of collateral items with specific details.

**Entities:**  
- **Number of items:** 20  
- **Attributes requested:** type, value, valuation date, related LoanNumber  
- **Entity:** collateral items  
- **Relationship:** Each collateral item is related to a LoanNumber

========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
- **Entities Mapping:** Collateral items (from dbo.Collateral) linked to their respective loans (dbo.Loan) via LoanId, showing type, value, valuation date, and LoanNumber.
- **Tables/Joins:** Join dbo.Collateral with dbo.Loan on LoanId to access LoanNumber for each collateral entry.
- **Aggregations:** No aggregation required; return individual collateral items.
- **Filters:** None specified, but only 20 results are requested.
- **Order/Limit:** Apply LIMIT (TOP 20) to restrict the output to 20 items; order is not specified, so default ordering will be used.
- **Assumptions:** CollateralType maps to "type"; ValueAmount to "value"; ValuationDate to "valuation date"; all collateral items are eligible unless further filtering is required.
