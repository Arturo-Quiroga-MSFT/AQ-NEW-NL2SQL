## üîó Multi-Fact Query Validation

Successfully tested comprehensive query joining 6 fact tables:
```sql
SELECT 
    c.CustomerSegment,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerKey) as TotalCustomers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT app.ApplicationKey) as TotalApplications,
    COUNT(DISTINCT lo.LoanKey) as TotalLoans,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.PaymentKey) as TotalPayments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT b.BalanceKey) as TotalBalanceSnapshots,
    COUNT(DISTINCT i.InteractionKey) as TotalInteractions
FROM dim.DimCustomer c
LEFT JOIN fact.FACT_LOAN_APPLICATION app ...
LEFT JOIN fact.FACT_LOAN_ORIGINATION lo ...
LEFT JOIN fact.FACT_PAYMENT_TRANSACTION p ...
LEFT JOIN fact.FACT_LOAN_BALANCE_DAILY b ...
LEFT JOIN fact.FACT_CUSTOMER_INTERACTION i ...
```

**Results by Customer Segment:**

| Segment | Customers | Apps | Loans | Payments | Balances | Interactions | Loan Volume | Payments Received |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|----------|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Large Corporate | 116 | 305 | 157 | 595 | 360 | 820 | $4.96T | $108.8B |

The complete dataset now supports sophisticated analytical queries:

### Portfolio Performance Analysis
- "Show me the total loan balance and allowance by delinquency status"
- "What is the payment compliance rate by customer segment?"
- "Which loan products have the highest prepayment rates?"

### Customer Engagement Analysis
- "How many service interactions required follow-up by channel?"
- "What is the average interaction duration by type and outcome?"
- "Show me customers with the most interactions in the last 6 months"

### Payment Behavior Analysis
- "What is the distribution of payment methods by customer segment?"
- "Show me late payment trends by loan product"
- "Calculate the average days late for payments by risk rating"

### Balance Trend Analysis
- "Show me the balance progression for loans over time"
- "What is the CECL allowance percentage by delinquency bucket?"
- "Track principal paydown rates by term length"

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- "Show me loan performance including payments, balances, and customer interactions"
- "Analyze customer journey from application through loan origination to payments"
- "Correlate customer interactions with payment behavior"

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Column Name Validation:** Always query actual schema before assuming column names
2. **Dimension Value Verification:** Query dimension tables for actual values (MethodName, TypeName, StatusName)
3. **Incremental Generation:** Check existing data counts before generating to avoid duplicates
4. **Batch Size Optimization:** 500 records per batch provided good performance
5. **Data Volume Management:** Allow users to stop long-running processes and still have usable datasets
6. **Schema Consistency:** Use dim.Dim[TableName] naming convention consistently

---

## ‚ú® Next Steps

The database is ready for:

1. **NL2SQL Application Configuration:** Point the NL2SQL app to TERADATA-FI database
2. **Demo Query Testing:** Test various natural language queries
3. **Performance Tuning:** Add indexes if needed for large-scale queries
4. **Additional Fact Tables:** Can generate FACT_CUSTOMER_FINANCIALS and FACT_COVENANT_TEST if needed
5. **Data Refresh:** Scripts can be re-run to add more data incrementally
