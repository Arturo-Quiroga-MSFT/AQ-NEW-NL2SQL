# NL2SQL Standalone Package - Creation Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Created by:** GitHub Copilot
**Location:** `nl2sql_standalone/`

## Overview
A self-contained copy of the NL2SQL pipeline has been created in the `nl2sql_standalone/` directory. All necessary files have been **COPIED** (not moved) so the original files remain intact in the parent directory.

## Files Copied to `nl2sql_standalone/`

### Core Python Files (3 files)
1. ✓ `nl2sql_main.py` - Main NL2SQL pipeline entry point
2. ✓ `schema_reader.py` - Database schema reading utility  
3. ✓ `sql_executor.py` - SQL query execution utility

### Configuration Files (3 files)
4. ✓ `.env` - Environment variables (Azure OpenAI & SQL credentials) ⚠️ SENSITIVE
5. ✓ `azure_openai_pricing.json` - Token pricing configuration
6. ✓ `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies

### Documentation Files Created (3 files)
7. ✓ `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions
8. ✓ `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns
9. ✓ `FILE_INVENTORY.md` - Detailed file inventory

### Directories Created (1 directory)
10. ✓ `RESULTS/` - Output directory for query results

## Verification
✅ Standalone package tested successfully with `--whoami` flag
✅ All dependencies identified and included
✅ Configuration files copied
✅ Documentation created

## Usage
To use the standalone package:

```bash
cd nl2sql_standalone
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python nl2sql_main.py
```

## Cleanup Notes
The original files in the parent directory are **UNTOUCHED**. When you're ready to clean up:

1. **Verify** the standalone version works for your needs
2. **Test** with actual queries to ensure all dependencies are included
3. **Archive or delete** the original files if desired:
   - `nl2sql_main.py`
   - `schema_reader.py`
   - `sql_executor.py`
   - `azure_openai_pricing.json`
   
4. **DO NOT DELETE** from parent directory:
   - `.env` (keep as backup or move to secure location)
   - `requirements.txt` (may be used by other scripts)

## Security Reminder
⚠️ The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials. Ensure:
- Proper access controls on the directory
- The file is not committed to git (covered by .gitignore)
- Backups are stored securely

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test standalone package with real queries
- [ ] Create separate virtual environment for standalone package
- [ ] Update git repository if needed
- [ ] Archive or remove original files from parent directory
- [ ] Document any other scripts that depend on these files
