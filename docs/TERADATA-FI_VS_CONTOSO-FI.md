JOIN Company c ON l.CompanyId = c.CompanyId
WHERE l.Status = 'Active';
```

        e.EmployeeName,
        b.BranchName,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l.LoanId) AS OriginationCount,
        SUM(l.PrincipalAmount) AS TotalVolume,
        AVG(l.InterestRate) AS AvgRate,
        AVG(DATEDIFF(day, a.ApplicationDate, l.OriginationDate)) AS AvgDaysToClose,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

**BUILD TERADATA-FI as a separate database (Option C ‚Üí Option A path)**

**Rationale:**
1. Existing CONTOSO-FI demos continue to work (no disruption)
2. TERADATA-FI becomes the "advanced demo" showcase
3. Clean slate allows proper star schema design
4. Over time, retire CONTOSO-FI once TERADATA-FI is mature
5. Competitive advantage in market (no other NL2SQL solution has this depth)

**Timeline:** 5 weeks for full implementation  
**Payoff:** Immediate differentiation, higher win rates, broader buyer audience  
**Risk:** Low (parallel operation, no disruption to existing demos)
