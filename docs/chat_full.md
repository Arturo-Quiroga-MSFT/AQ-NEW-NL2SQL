**Q: what mssqql mcp tools do you have access to**

```
GitHub Copilot: I can use the following MSSQL MCP tools right now (these let me discover servers, connect, inspect schema, and run queries):

Discovery & connection
1. mssql_list_servers – List available SQL Server connections configured in this environment.
2. mssql_connect – Open a connection to a specific server (optionally a database); returns a connection ID.
3. mssql_get_connection_details – Show server/database/auth info for an existing connection.
4. mssql_disconnect – Close a connection.

Database selection
5. mssql_change_database – Switch the active database for an existing connection.

Schema exploration
6. mssql_list_databases – List databases on the connected server.
7. mssql_list_schemas – List schemas in the current database.
8. mssql_list_tables – List tables (with schema) in the current database.
9. mssql_list_views – List views (with schema) in the current database.
10. mssql_list_functions – List user-defined functions.
11. mssql_show_schema – Open a visual/graphical schema view (schema designer) for exploration.

Query execution
12. mssql_run_query – Execute any T-SQL (SELECT / DML / DDL). (Powerful—must be careful with destructive commands.)

Typical safe workflow
- Enumerate servers: mssql_list_servers
- Connect: mssql_connect
- List databases then switch if needed: mssql_list_databases -> mssql_change_database
- Explore structure: mssql_list_schemas / tables / views / functions
- (Optionally) visualize: mssql_show_schema
- Run read-only queries first: mssql_run_query (SELECT ...)
- Only then perform writes/DDL if explicitly requested
- Disconnect when done: mssql_disconnect

Good practices I’ll follow
- I won’t run destructive (DROP/DELETE/UPDATE) statements unless you explicitly ask.
- For data-changing queries I can show you the statement first for confirmation.
- For large result sets I can LIMIT / TOP / WHERE-filter to keep output manageable.
- I can help craft parameterized or staged queries (preview with SELECT before UPDATE).

Let me know what you’d like to do next (e.g., list servers, connect, inspect a table, run one of the demo questions’ SQL, etc.) and I can proceed.
```

**Q: list servers and DBs you have access to**

```
GitHub Copilot: Listing available SQL Servers then connecting to each to enumerate its databases. 

Listing server connections
Completed with input: {}

Connecting to both servers (same host, different DBs) to list their databases. 

Connecting to server aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net and database adventureworksdb
Completed with input: {
  "serverName": "aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net",
  "database": "adventureworksdb"
}

Connecting to server aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net and database CONTOSO-FI
Completed with input: {
  "serverName": "aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net",
  "database": "CONTOSO-FI"
}

Listing databases for connection '805c7674-2d47-4589-a901-3bda8e4bc96a'
Completed with input: {
  "connectionId": "805c7674-2d47-4589-a901-3bda8e4bc96a"
}

## Servers and Databases Accessible

I enumerated the configured SQL Server profiles and probed database lists where I could connect.

### Server profiles found
1. ADVENTUREWORKS → Host: aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net, Default DB: adventureworksdb (connection attempt failed)
2. CONTOSO-FI → Host: aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net, Default DB: CONTOSO-FI (connected successfully)

Both profiles point to the same Azure SQL logical server host.

### Successful connection
- Connected to: aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net (profile: CONTOSO-FI)
- Databases visible on that server: 
  - CONTOSO-FI
  - master
  - Multi_Dimentional_Modeling

### Failed connection
- adventureworksdb (profile ADVENTUREWORKS) returned: Failed to connect to server.
  - Possible causes: database doesn’t exist, firewall / permissions, different credentials required, or case/name mismatch.

## Next Options
Let me know if you’d like to:
- Switch to another database (e.g., master) and list schemas/tables
- Retry or troubleshoot the AdventureWorks connection (I can test without specifying the DB, then change DB if successful)
- Run any of the complex analytical queries you listed
- Inspect table structures to help refine NL2SQL prompts

Tell me which direction to go and I’ll proceed.
```

**Q: Inspect table structures to help refine NL2SQL prompts**

```
GitHub Copilot: I'll enumerate all tables in the CONTOSO-FI database, then inspect their columns and types to provide a schema summary for NL2SQL prompt refinement. 

...existing code...
```

**Q: Run one of the complex analytical queries I listed, you choose which one**

```
GitHub Copilot: I'll run the query: "For each loan, what is the total value of collateral pledged, and which loans are under-collateralized?" This query exercises joins, aggregation, and a CASE statement—ideal for testing NL2SQL and schema understanding.

...existing code...
```

**Q: show first 10 rows and also show me the SLQ query**

```
GitHub Copilot: I'll re-run the query to fetch only the first 10 rows and display both the SQL and the results for you.

...existing code...
```

**Q: modify the pertinent table or tables needed to have more diverse collateral status**

```
GitHub Copilot: Querying collateral row details for candidate loans to design targeted updates creating under-collateralized cases. 

...existing code...
```

**Q: Run any of the complex analytical queries you listed**

```
GitHub Copilot: 
```

**Q: APPROVE UPDATES + ADD NEW LOAN**

```
GitHub Copilot: Fetching Loan table schema and a sample row to determine required columns for insert.
