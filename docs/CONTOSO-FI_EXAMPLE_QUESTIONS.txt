Curated questions designed to consistently return rows based on available schema and typical seed data. Prompts favor broad time ranges, top-N selections, and aggregates to avoid empty results during demos.

EASY
-----
1) Show the 10 most recent loans by OriginationDate.
2) Show the 10 upcoming loan maturities (soonest MaturityDate first) with principal amount and status.
3) List 20 companies with their industry and credit rating.
4) List 20 collateral items with type, value, valuation date, and the related LoanNumber.
5) Show 20 payment schedule entries (earliest DueDate first) with LoanNumber, PaymentNumber, and TotalDue.
6) List all currencies and their symbols available in the system.
7) Show 20 covenants with covenant type, threshold, frequency, and status.
8) Show 20 covenant test results with test date, status, observed value, and the related covenant type.

MEDIUM
-------
1) For each company with loans, compute total principal amount; show the top 20 companies by total principal.
2) Average interest rate by industry and region (join Loan → Company → Country → Region).
3) Count of loans by status per country (join Loan → Company → Country).
4) Total collateral value per loan with the associated company name; show the top 20 by total collateral value.
5) Number of covenant test results per covenant type (all-time).
6) Average days to maturity by industry (for loans with non-null OriginationDate and MaturityDate).
7) For each region, list the top 5 companies by total principal amount.
8) Payment performance overview: counts of Paid vs. Unpaid payment schedule entries (all-time).

COMPLICATED
------------
1) For each loan, compute month-over-month change in EndingPrincipal from PaymentSchedule; show 20 loans with the largest absolute change (include positive/negative flags).
2) Covenant compliance rate by industry: percentage of covenant tests with Status = "Pass" (all-time), grouped by industry and calendar quarter.
3) Weighted average interest rate by region and currency (weighted by PrincipalAmount).
4) Covenant schedules: list the next 20 upcoming covenant test due dates with the company and covenant type (earliest TestDueDate first).
5) Payment timing analysis: average days between DueDate and PaidDate by company and by calendar quarter (paid entries only).
6) Rate structure mix by region: counts and total principal by InterestRateType and ReferenceRate.
7) Collateral coverage ratio per loan = sum(collateral value) / principal; show the top 50 loans by coverage ratio and flag those below 1.2.
8) Origination trend by region: monthly count and sum of new loans across all available years, with a 3-month moving average per region.

STRESS (ADVANCED SQL)
----------------------
1) As-of-balance: for each region, using the latest available DueDate per loan from PaymentSchedule, sum EndingPrincipal by company and show the top 3 companies per region with each company’s share of the region total.
2) Delinquency buckets by month and region: using PaymentEvent, bucket DaysDelinquent into 0–29, 30–59, 60–89, and 90+ and show, for the 6 most recent months in the data, each bucket’s percentage of total per region.
3) Coverage-bucket rates: for the most recent year in the data, compute weighted average interest rate by collateral coverage ratio bucket (<50%, 50–70%, 70–80%, >80%) and collateral type.
4) For the latest month in the data, by region and loan purpose, show the mix of fixed vs variable rate loans (counts and percentages) and the month-over-month percentage point change.
5) By region, list the top 10 companies by estimated outstanding balance (using latest EndingPrincipal per loan), show each company’s share of the regional total, and include an "Others" row aggregating the remainder.
