Query: List all risk metrics for companies in the Technology industry.

Intent & Entities (JSON):
{
  "intent": "Core goal: Retrieve the set of risk metrics (and optionally their values) associated with companies classified in the Technology industry.\nKey entities/tables: Companies (with industry/sector classification), RiskMetrics dimension/definitions, and a CompanyRiskMetrics or similar fact table holding metric values (and timestamps).\nFilters/aggregation: Filter companies where industry = 'Technology'; list distinct metric names across those companies (or metric values per company); if time-series exists, use latest/effective date per company-metric."
}

Reasoning / Plan:
- Entities/Source Tables: Use dbo.Company (CompanyId, CompanyName, Industry) linked with dbo.RiskMetricHistory (CompanyId, AsOfDate, MetricName, MetricValue, Source); include only these unless company legal details are specifically needed (then add dbo.CustomerProfile for LegalName).
- Link Logic: Relate dbo.RiskMetricHistory to dbo.Company on CompanyId; use an inner relationship so only companies that actually have risk metric records are returned.
- Filters: Restrict to companies where Industry equals 'Technology' (treat casing/whitespace robustly); require MetricName not null; optionally constrain AsOfDate to the latest snapshot per company-metric (default) or to a user-provided date range; optionally filter by Source if a specific provider is desired.
- Latest-effective logic: For each CompanyId + MetricName, rank rows by AsOfDate descending (then by RiskMetricHistoryId descending as a deterministic tie-breaker) and keep only the top-ranked row to represent the current metric value; if only the set of metric names is needed, return the deduped list of MetricName after applying the Technology company filter.
- Output fields: Include CompanyName (and CompanyId if helpful), MetricName, MetricValue, AsOfDate; if the requirement is only to enumerate which metrics exist, return just MetricName (unique) without values.
- Aggregations: No numeric aggregation required; only deduplication/windowing to get one current record per company-metric or to produce a unique list of metric names.
- Ordering/Row capping: Sort by CompanyName then MetricName (or by MetricName then CompanyName if listing the catalog of metrics); optionally cap the row count for previews.
- Potential edge cases: Companies with null/blank Industry; inconsistent ‘Technology’ labeling requiring case-insensitive matching; companies with no risk metrics (excluded by the inner link); multiple records sharing the same AsOfDate and metric (handled by tie-breaker); null MetricValue or placeholder values; duplicate metric names across different sources (decide whether to treat Source as part of uniqueness).
