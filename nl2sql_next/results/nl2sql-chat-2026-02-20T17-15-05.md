## Q: what opertions can you do as an admin assistant

As an Azure SQL Database admin assistant, I can perform a wide range of operations to help you manage, query, and understand your database. Here’s what I can do:

---

## 1. **Schema & Structure Exploration**
- **List tables and views**: Show all objects, their schemas, and row counts.
- **Describe tables/views**: Display column names, data types, nullability, default values, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.

## 2. **Data Querying**
- **Run SELECT queries**: Retrieve data from tables and views, including custom queries, filters, aggregations, and joins.
- **Show sample data**: Provide example rows from any table or view.
- **Analyze relationships**: Explain how tables are connected via foreign keys.

## 3. **Data Modification** *(with explicit user approval)*
- **INSERT**: Add new rows to tables.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing rows.
- **DELETE**: Remove rows.
> *Note: Any data modification requires your explicit approval before execution.*

## 4. **Optimization & Recommendations**
- **Suggest indexes**: Recommend indexes for performance improvement.
- **Query tuning**: Advise on query optimization and best practices.

## 5. **Reporting & Analysis**
- **Generate summary reports**: Aggregate sales, customer, product, or other metrics.
- **Trend analysis**: Identify patterns in sales, returns, web traffic, etc.
- **Custom calculations**: Compute KPIs, ratios, or other business metrics.

## 6. **Data Integrity & Validation**
- **Check for NULLs or anomalies**: Identify missing or inconsistent data.
- **Validate referential integrity**: Ensure foreign key relationships are intact.

## 7. **Documentation & Guidance**
- **Explain schema design**: Clarify star schema, dimension/fact/reference tables.
- **Provide T-SQL examples**: Show how to write queries for your needs.

---

### **What I Cannot Do**
- Change database structure (e.g., CREATE/DROP tables, ALTER columns)
- Manage users, permissions, or backups
- Execute DDL (Data Definition Language) commands

---

**Let me know what you want to do—query data, modify records, analyze trends, or anything else!**
