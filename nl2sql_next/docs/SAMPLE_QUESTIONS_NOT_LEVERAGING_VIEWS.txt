Here are sample business questions that *require querying base tables* and doing joins across your star schema (dims/facts/ref). I’ll reference the actual objects in RetailDW.

Customer + Orders (dim.DimCustomer ↔ fact.FactOrders ↔ dim.DimDate)

1. Which customers generated the highest profit in 2024, and what are their order counts?
2. What is the average order value by MembershipTier and Region over the last 12 months?
3. How does profit margin vary by AgeGroup and Gender by quarter?
4. Who are the top 50 customers by revenue whose last order date was more than 180 days ago (churn risk)?
5. What is the customer acquisition trend: monthly orders from customers whose SignupDate falls in that same month?

Product performance (dim.DimProduct ↔ fact.FactOrders ↔ dim.DimDate)

6. What are the top 20 products by profit, and what is their units sold and avg discount per unit?
7. Which brands have the highest return rate (requires join to returns)?
8. For each category/subcategory, what is the trend of revenue and profit by month?

Returns analysis (fact.FactReturns ↔ ref.RefReturnReason + dims)

9. What are the most common return reasons by Category and Brand?
10. Which stores/regions have the highest return rate and refund amount per unit?
11. Are discounted items returned more often than non-discounted ones? (join fact.FactReturns to fact.FactOrders on OrderId + LineNumber)
12. What is the time-to-return distribution (days between order date and return date) by reason?

Promotions effectiveness (dim.DimPromotion ↔ fact.FactOrders ↔ dim.DimDate)

13. Which promotions drove the most incremental profit vs. non-promoted orders?
14. What is the average discount and profit margin by PromotionType over time?
15. Do promotions increase units per order or just reduce margin?

Store & shipping (dim.DimStore / dim.DimShippingMethod ↔ fact.FactOrders)

16. Revenue/profit by StoreType and Region, including online vs. physical comparison.
17. Which shipping methods have the highest average shipping cost and how does that impact profit?
18. What is the average ship lag (ShipDate - OrderDate) by CarrierName and month?

Payment method insights (dim.DimPaymentMethod ↔ fact.FactOrders)

19. What is the mix of payment providers by revenue, and which has the highest avg order value?
20. Do certain payment methods correlate with higher return rates (join orders + returns + payment method)?

Inventory + sales (fact.FactInventory ↔ dim.DimProduct ↔ dim.DimStore ↔ dim.DimDate, plus optionally FactOrders)

21. Which products are most frequently below ReorderPoint by store and month?
22. For each store, what is the relationship between inventory on hand and units sold in the following week/month?
23. Identify potential overstock: high QuantityOnHand with low trailing 90-day sales.

Web traffic to conversion (fact.FactWebTraffic ↔ dim.DimDate ↔ dim.DimCustomer, and optionally orders)

24. Conversion rate by TrafficSource and DeviceType over time.
25. Do customers with longer SessionDurationSec have higher order frequency? (traffic ↔ customer ↔ orders)
26. What percent of sessions with AddedToCart > 0 result in an order within 7 days? (needs logic and joins)

If you tell me which area you care about (returns, promos, inventory, web traffic, etc.), I can turn 3–5 of these into exact single-SELECT T‑SQL queries using your two-part names.
